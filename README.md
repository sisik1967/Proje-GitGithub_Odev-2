<h1> Landing Page Web Site Design</h1>

I designed a Landing Page Web Site for Africa.

There are 4 menu items, 1 logo, and 1 buttons on the main page

There is also a general statement on the Home page.

I used mix-blend mode using a picture and a video in the project.

I added a span feature on the list items which were not in the original project.

I also added a ref and span feature on the question mark which were not in the original project.

I also added a span feature on the button which was not in the original project.
